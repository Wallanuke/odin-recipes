<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These grilled peaches are stuffed and made in the air fryer. 
    I like mine simple. I just pour cream over them. 
    But feel free to top them off with whipped cream or ice cream.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Â¼ cup quick-cooking oats</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> 
    <li>3 medium peaches, halved and pitted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>    
    <li>Combine oats, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Spoon out some of the flesh of the peaches. Place peaches skin side up into the air fryer basket. Air fry for 5 minutes. 
        Turn peaches over and spoon 1/2 tablespoon of the oat mixture into each cavity. 
        Air fry until oats are golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
